                    <h3 id="MT">Movable Type</h3>
                    <p>In the beginning, scribes were manufacturing books or documents by hand.
                        The first typefaces were modeled on forms of <b>calligraphy</b> to mimic the handwriting of
                        scribes.
                    </p>
                    <p><b>Movable type</b> was invented by Johannes Gutenberg in Germany in the early 15th century.
                        The Gutenburg Bible was the earliest major book printed in Western Europe from movable type.
                    </p>
                    <p>Moveable type revolutionized writing as printing with type allowed for <b>mass production</b> of
                        printed items.
                        Large quantities of letters could be cast from a mold and assembled into forms.

                    <h3 id="HLA">Humanists and Lettera Antica</h3>
                    <p>Later in the 15th century, humanist writers and scholars rejected the original gothic scripts
                        and favored a more classic, open way of writing called <b>lettera antica</b>.
                    </p>
                    <p>We owe a great debt to the Humanists as it was the script they created that became the model
                        for <b>small letters</b>. The renaissance practice and analysis during this period of time was
                        also applied
                        to type- making a more mathematically perfect (rationalized) letter.
                    </p>
                    <p>Some humanist typefaces are still in use today: Garamond, Bembo, Palatino, and Jenson.

                    <h3 id="AMF">Advertisements and Monster Fonts</h3>
                    <p>With the rise of industrialization and mass consumption in 19th century, <b>advertisements</b>
                        came which
                        created a new form of communicationâ€¦ and the need for new kinds of typography.
                    </p>
                    <p>Type designers created big, bold type faces by <b>embellishing or exaggerating</b> letters and
                        their parts.
                        Fonts appeared which broke the conventions of height, width, and depth. Fonts began being cut
                        from wood
                        to print at larger scales and, when combined with a tracing device and router, many variants
                        could be made for each letter.
                    </p>
                    <p>Typography became an <b>elastic system</b> of letter features (weight, stress, serifs, angles,
                        curves, etc.)
                        and the relationship between letters became important.

                    <h3 id="RR">Reform and Revolution</h3>
                    <p>In the early 20th century, some typographic designers began to reject the exaggerated typefaces
                        that arose during the 19th century as a part of industrialization and advertisements, They
                        began looking for uncorrupted letter forms and referred to the <b>Renaissance period</b> for
                        inspiration.
                    </p>
                    <p>These reformers were attached to history but they created a new definition for typographic
                        designers
                        as intellectuals/scholars detached from the commercial mainstream meaning they were defined <b>outside
                            of the consumerism needs</b>.
                    </p>
                    <p>Outside of the reformers, typefaces continued to be produced, but with a emphasis on <b>function
                        over form</b>
                        with the popular Futura font being created in 1927 and is still used to this day.

                    <h3 id="TDA">Type in the Digital Age</h3>
                    <p>The rise of electronic communication and personal computers brought on a new font
                        production method: <b>video screens</b>. On these screens, curves and angles rendered as
                        straight lines and original typefaces of this period leaned into the straight line
                        or dot which presented well on these screens.
                    </p>
                    <p>In the early 1990s, digital design tools began allowing <b>digital reproduction</b> and
                        integration
                        of different types of media. This brought on a wave of new experimentation: producing typefaces
                        which were warped, bent, and imperfect.
                    </p>
                    <p>Existing typefaces were combined (Dead History), typefaces gained new sources of inspiration
                        (Template Gothic),
                        and new productions methods entered the field (Beowulf, the first programmed typeface).
