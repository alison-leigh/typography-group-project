            <h3 id="MT">Movable Type</h3>
            <p>In the beginning, scribes were manufacturing books or documents by hand. 
                The first typefaces were modeled on forms of <b>calligraphy</b> to mimic the handwriting of scribes. 
            </p>
            <p><b>Movable type</b> was invented by Johannes Gutenberg in Germany in the early 15th century.
                The Gutenburg Bible was the earliest major book printed in Western Europe from movable type.
            </p>
            <p>Moveable type revolutionized writing as printing with type allowed for <b>mass production</b> of printed items. 
                Large quantities of letters could be cast from a mold and assembled into forms.
            </p>

            <h3 id="HLA">Humanists and Lettera Antica</h3>
            <p>Later in the 15th century, humanist writers and scholars rejected the original gothic scripts
                 and favored a more classic, open way of writing called <b>lettera antica</b>. 
            </p>
            <p>We owe a great debt to the Humanists as it was the script they created that became the model
                 for <b>small letters</b>. The renaissance practice and analysis during this period of time was also applied
                  to type- making a more mathematically perfect (rationalized) letter.
            </p>
            <p>Some humanist typefaces are still in use today: Garamond, Bembo, Palatino, and Jenson.

            <h3 id="AMF">Advertisements and Monster Fonts</h3>
            <p>With the rise of industrialization and mass consumption in 19th century, <b>advertisements</b> came which 
                created a new form of communication… and the need for new kinds of typography. 
            </p>
            <p>Type designers created big, bold type faces by <b>embellishing or exaggerating</b> letters and their parts. 
                Fonts appeared which broke the conventions of height, width, and depth. Fonts began being cut from wood
                 to print at larger scales and, when combined with a tracing device and router, many variants 
                 could be made for each letter. 
            </p>
            <p>Typography became an <b>elastic system</b> of letter features (weight, stress, serifs, angles, curves, etc.) 
                and the relationship between letters became important.
            </p>

        <div class="infoContainer col m-3 p-2">
            <h3 id="RR">Reform and Revolution</h3>
            <p>In the early 20th century, some typographic designers began to reject the exaggerated typefaces
                 that arose during the 19th century as a part of industrialization and advertisements, They 
                 began looking for uncorrupted letter forms and referred to the <b>Renaissance period</b> for inspiration.
            </p>
            <p>These reformers were attached to history but they created a new definition for typographic designers
                 as intellectuals/scholars detached from the commercial mainstream meaning they were defined <b>outside 
                 of the consumerism needs</b>. 
            </p>
            <p>Outside of the reformers, typefaces continued to be produced, but with a emphasis on <b>function over form</b>
                 with the popular Futura font being created in 1927 and is still used to this day.

            <h3 id="TDA">Type in the Digital Age</h3>
            <p>The rise of electronic communication and personal computers brought on a new font
                 production method: <b>video screens</b>. On these screens, curves and angles rendered as 
                 straight lines and original typefaces of this period leaned into the straight line 
                 or dot which presented well on these screens. 
            </p>
            <p>In the early 1990s, digital design tools began allowing <b>digital reproduction</b> and integration
                 of different types of media. This brought on a wave of new experimentation: producing typefaces
                  which were warped, bent, and imperfect.
            </p>
            <p>Existing typefaces were combined (Dead History), typefaces gained new sources of inspiration (Template Gothic),
                 and new productions methods entered the field (Beowulf, the first programmed typeface).
